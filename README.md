# C4C Fall Challenge 2024

### Overview
This challenge consisted of creating a dashboard for C4C's current community partners. 
The user has the ability to add or delete the partners. Each partner tile contains their
name, a brief description, an image, and whether they are an active partner or not.

### Instructions
1. Clone the repo onto your computer.
2. In a terminal, run [npm install] and [npm install axios] at the root of this project.
3. Run [npm run dev] at the root of this project.
4. Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the website, with the backend visible at [http://localhost:4000]

### Design Decisions
The design elements chosen were based off the starter code.

### Reflection
With my previous experience with web dev limited to basics of HTML/JS/CSS, learning React,
Express, and backend/frontend on the fly was quite difficult, though rewarding. Knowing what I know now, I would
approach the project in a different manner, laying out the steps to take before diving in. 
If I had more time, I would have adjusted the aesthetics a bit, as well as adding filtering
abilities, linking the websites of the partners to their titles in the tiles, and ensuring
usability regardless of window size. The main issues I ran into were with implementing the 
update/delete of partner data, which I resolved by storing in a separate JSON file to ensure
consistency across users.
